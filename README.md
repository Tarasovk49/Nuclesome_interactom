# Nuclesome_interactom
**Part of a project dedicated to establishment of proteins interacting with nucleosomes.**

Establish interactions of human histones with human not-nucleosome proteins based on homology of these proteins to those derived from emdb and pdb for other species. In other words find human homologs to non-human protein complexes from emdb and pdb containing histones and they pose as potential human interactors.
